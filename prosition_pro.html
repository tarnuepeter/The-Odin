        We need to carefu with position when when we are writing CSS.

    <p class="first-paragraph">
        People often misuse prosition when wrting CSS, once they 
        discover it can move things to where ever they want things
        to be on the screen, but it can lead to a lot of problem, 
        especially with responsiveness, but can also lead to hard to 
        maintain code in general as well.

    <p class="second-paragraph">
        This demo is put together to help explore all the different
        position values we have, how they work, and how you might
        actually want to use them in real projects, as well as the  
        problems that can come up when using positioning and how we 
        can overcome (or avoid ) them.
    </p>

    <p class="third-paragraph">
        One of the most important things with positioning is being aware
        of all the side effects that come with using it, and also the
        different things we can do to properly control it to have it do.
