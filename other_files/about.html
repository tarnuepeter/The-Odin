    <h1>The About</h1>
    <p>
        An HTML attribute gives additional information to 
        an HTML element and always goes in the element’s 
        opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of 
        two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all 
        attributes require a value. In our case, we need 
        to add an href (hypertext reference) attribute to 
        the opening anchor tag. The value of the href 
        attribute is the destination we want our link 
        to go to.
    </p>
    <p>Add the following href attribute to the anchor element 
        we created previously and try clicking it again, 
        don’t forget to refresh the browser so the new 
        changes can be applied.
    </p>
